Description: Collection of scripts that access European Constitutional Court archives 
and retrieve their published decisions. Note that we scraped the data last beginning of 2022. 
Websites might have changed. Even though we are not able to keep the scripts up to date, 
we still believe that interested people can benefit from this resource.
